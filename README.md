How to create a certification website using honeycode

The requirements: 

```
You have been asked to provide a way to track all your teams from a manager level to show how many have got certified. Your organisation has just decided to invest in your technical teams and are providing training courses, online content and free vouchers in order to uplift your organisation to meet your requirements. 

Your manager has asked you to go and do a PoC (proof of concept), and you have heard of Honeycode as a potential option to do this.
You are already familiar with spreadsheets and forumla's, but you need to enable individuals to track their own details.
